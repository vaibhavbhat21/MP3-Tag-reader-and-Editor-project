# MP3-Tag-reader-and-Editor-project
■ MP3 Tag Reader & Editor in C

■ Project Overview
This is a terminal-based MP3 Tag Reader & Editor written in C that allows reading and modifying
ID3v2.3 metadata tags inside MP3 files.
The project was built as part of my learning at Emertxe Information Technologies under the
Certified Embedded Professional (ECEP) program.
It demonstrates low-level file handling, binary data parsing, CLI design, and modular
programming in C.

■ Features
• Display detailed MP3 metadata (Title, Artist, Album, Year, Genre, Composer, Lyricist,
Comments).
• Edit specific tags with updated values.
• Support for ID3v2.3 (partial for ID3v2.2).
• CLI-based tool for easy usage.
• Clean modular design (.c and .h separation).
• Robust error handling for invalid/missing files.

■ Tech Stack
Language: C (GCC)
Domain: MP3 (ID3v2) Metadata Handling
Environment: Linux Terminal
Tools: VS Code, GCC, Git

■ Key Learnings
• Understanding of MP3 file structure & ID3v2 format
• Working with binary file I/O (fopen, fread, fwrite)
• Implementing CLI argument parsing
• Writing modular & maintainable C programs
• Building practical system-level utilities
